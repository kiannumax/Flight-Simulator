All of the modules were written and tested on a MAC

Program currently uses a local based database, so it will not work on any other machine that doesn't
have the same database with same credentials.
Eventually this project will move to a cloud database, so multi-machine work will be possible.

Program currently uses 6 libraries(modules):
  4 built-in python3 libraries(modules): socket, sys, datetime, random
  And 2 global libraries(modules) which required an installation: bcrypt, geopy
