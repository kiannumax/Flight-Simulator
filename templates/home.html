                <p>Have you ever had a feeling to try yourself as a world explorer? If you did, then you would enjoy our
                    game called Air Dominance! You get to be a real airport explorer, but with some obstacles on the way,
                    of course. Game starts with you waking up in a random airport out of the all airports around the
                    world. Having 2000$ in the pocket, you have to travel the furthest distance from starting point.
                    After arriving at a new airport you will have a chance of losing or gaining money, depending on the
                    sustainability rating of the airport. Thatâ€™s why you should take into account the effect on the environment
                    when you achieve the goal of maximum traveled distance. Sounds exciting? Want to beat the records and be
                    number 1 on the Global Leaderboard? Go ahead, and log in into the system or create a new account! </p>

                <p>You wake up in a random airport with 2000$. Maximum of 10 of the nearest airports to your location
                    are getting shown, and you get to choose one of them as your next location. Your money decreases
                    according to the distance to the chosen airport (1km costs 2$!). Also, depending on a new airport type and
                    therefore its sustainability rating, you have of chance of keeping, losing, or gaining money. Then the new 10
                    airports are getting shown, once again. This cycle continues until you run out of money. Each finished
                    game gets saved to your profile, and your best game gets to be in the Global Leaderboard!</p>
