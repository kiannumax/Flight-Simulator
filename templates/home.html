            <p>In the game Air Dominance, the main character an explorer, wakes up at an airport with nothing but a
                flight with $2000 to buy fuel. The explorer must travel to different airports and scavenge and collect
                money from airports while avoiding airports that could have thieves. The airports that are occupied by
                thieves could lead to loss of money. The end goal of the explorer is to explore as much as possible and
                visit as many airports as possible. All this excitement is encapsulated into a single game that also
                consists of a leader board for the players to compare their scores and be the best explorer. </p>
